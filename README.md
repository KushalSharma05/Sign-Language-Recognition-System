# Sign-Language-Recognition-System
It is a real-time sign language detection system using a standard web camera to bridge communication between sign language users and nonsigners. The system recognizes gestures, converting them into voice output and on-screen text, while also translating voice input back into sign language gestures and on-screen text . Utilizing computer vision and deep learning, it captures hand and facial expressions to identify signs. This dual-functionality enhances accessibility and communication for the deaf community, facilitating interaction with hearing individuals, and has potential applications in education and healthcare
